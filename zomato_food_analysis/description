ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement: Zomato Restaurant Data Analysis
With the rapid expansion of the food delivery industry and growing competition among restaurants, understanding customer preferences and service performance is critical for success. However, raw datasets from platforms like Zomato often contain inconsistencies, missing values, and unstructured information that hinder data-driven decision-making.

The goal of this project is to clean, structure, and analyze a real-world Zomato restaurant dataset to uncover insights into customer behavior, service quality, pricing trends, and popular cuisines. The project aims to answer key business questions such as:

Which restaurants offer the best dining and delivery experiences?

How do ratings and vote counts vary across different cities?

Is there a correlation between cost and customer satisfaction?

What are the most popular cuisines in top-performing locations?
